        1. What is JavaScript?
    A high-level, interpreted programming language called JavaScript makes it possible to create interactive web pages and online apps with dynamic functionality.
     Commonly referred to as the universal language, Javascript is primarily used by developers for front-end and back-end work. -->


    <!-- 2
     what is Client side and server side

     A clinet side is a device, appplication,or software component that requests and consumes service or resources from a server
     A server is a device , or software application that provide service , resources of funtions to clients.
      -->

    <!-- 3.
     what is scope in JavaScript

     scope are three types

     global variable
     funtion variable
     block variable

     scope determines where variables are defiend and where they can be accessed -->


    <!-- 4. what is the type of variable in JavaScript where it is decleared without using the var, let,const keywords

    if (true){
    variable=25;
    console.log(variable);
    } -->



    <!-- 5. 
    what is the hoisting in Javascript
sol- check 2 types- of hoisting

my function(); -- function hoisting
function myfunction(){
    console.log(RRcoders);
}


x=25;-- variable hoisting
console.log(x)
var x; 

Hoisting is a javascript behavior where funtions and 
variable declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the competition phase -->



    <!-- 6.
    what is json
    json is javascript object notation a light weight data interchange format
    json consist of key -value pairs -->


    <!-- // 7
    what are variables ? what is diffrence b/w var,let , const?

    variables are used to store data

    var- var creates a function scoped vaiable
    funtion example(){
    if(true){
    vare count=20;
    console.log(count);
    }
    console.log(count);
    }

    let- let creates a block scoped vairbales
    funtion example (){
    if(true){
    let count =10;
    console.log(count)
    }
    console.log(count);
    }

    const- const can be assigned only once and its value can not be changed afterwards
    const z= 10;
    z= 20;
    console.log(z)

    one more example & defination

    let and const were introduced in ES6 and have block scope.
    let is reassignable, and const is non-reassignable.
    var is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned throughout the function.

    let x=5;
    x=10;
    console.log(x)
    op-10

    const y=5;
    y=10
    console.log(y);
    error assignment to constant vairbale

    var z = 5;
    var z=10;
    console.log(z)
    op- 10 -->


//8
what are data types in js

twoo types - primitive  and non primitive
primitive - numbers, string, booleans, undefined, null

primitive data types can hold only siingle value
primitive data types are immutable means their value can not be changed

let age=30;
age=40;


non- primitiva- object , array, function, date etc

non primitive data types can hold multiple values 
they are mutable means their value will changed
non primitive data types are complex data types

//arry-

let odd numbers=[1,2,3,4,5]

//object
let persion ={
    name:'RRcoders',
    age:'24',
    grades:["A","B","C"]
    great:function(){
        console.log (this.name);
    }
    

}
